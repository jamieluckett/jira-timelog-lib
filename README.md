# jira-timelog-lib
jira-timelog-lib is a small Python library written as a wrapper around the
[pycontribs/jira](https://github.com/pycontribs/jira)
library to provide data used in
[jamieluckett/jira-timecritic-argos](https://github.com/jamieluckett/jira-timecritic-argos).

It is not designed for use in other scripts/projects as of now but has 
been written in such a way that it should be easy enough in future.
